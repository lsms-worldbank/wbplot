Description: A set of tools for producing plots aligned with World Bank's
    visual identity. For colors, a collection of corporate colors and color
    palettes derived from them. For fonts, a means of effortlessly loading
    corporate fonts or, failing that, their rough equivalents.
    And for plot themes, a curated set of themes tailored to the needs of
    common plot types and offering toggles for common plot type-specific
    choices (e.g., enable grid lines, axis titles, etc).
